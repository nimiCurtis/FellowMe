    <!-- The `minimal.launch` is used to load the fellowme's robot descripton
        and the controller configuration onto the ROS parameter server using the launch file from the 
        `fellowme_base` package (https://fjp.at/projects/fellowme/ros-packages/base/). 
        It will also setup the ROS controller manager (http://wiki.ros.org/controller_manager) with 
        fellowme's hardware interface https://fjp.at/projects/fellowme/ros-packages/base/#hardware-interface.
        For the motor driver the node `motor_driver.py` from the `grove_motor_driver` package is started.
        And for the encoders rosserial communicates with the Teensy microcontroller to publish the encoder ticks.
